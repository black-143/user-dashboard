In this assignment I designed few screens where the user can choose from a list of users profile to visit and get the details.

## Libraries Used:

axios

react-router-dom

## Flow:

- User can choose a particular user from the list of available users in the first page.

- Based on the user selected the details of them are displayed.

- Few of the pages are landing pages so when clicked on Posts, Gallery, Todo a coming soon page is displayed.
